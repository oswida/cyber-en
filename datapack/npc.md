## Antagonists

A quick generator of antagonists in the form of a squad and examples of individual representatives of a particular type.

The principle of determining character abilities:

- HP is **3** if not specified
- Abilities (BIO,PSY,INF) are **10** if not specified
- Armor is **0** if not specified

The term `X/Y` specifies the probability of the feature occurence during a clash.

> Example
> Snipers in a given squad give a `1/6` chance that a character's attack in the current round will be accounted for as enhanced. In other words, for each round, you roll a d6 once and if the result is 1 - one, selected attack can be resolved as **enhanced**.

Procedure, roll or select:

- squad type (determines the primary weapon)
- characteristics of the group
- leader's profile
- profiles of the group members
- additional weapons
- a detail specific to that squad

### Type (d6)

1. Gang/other runner group (weapon d6)
2. Police/guards (weapon d6)
